Description: forrestFloor visualizes cross-validated topology-maps of randomForests(RF).
  Package enables users to understand a non-linear, regression problem or a binary
  classification problem through RF. Applying analysis on grown trees,
  'feature contributions'  for each observation and each variable is calculated.
  Thereby this packacge  can separate and plot non-linear main-effects by
  each variable. Furthermore screening of iteractions and redundencies of variables.
  Mapping of local interactions effects. Topologies are intrinsicly OOB cross-validated.
  3D rgl.plots and automatic colouring   enables  easy visualization of interactions,
  including automatic estimation of   response surface. Any plot include  the actual data
  points allowing the user to evaluate wether enough is represerented in a given subspace
  of a multivariate system to support an idea of a local effect/interaction. Specific
  corlinearities will confound specific interactions. With RF in general comes also
  robustness to noise, identification of most important variables, high adaptness  to
  non-linear problems, robust default paremeter settings and native scaling of model to
  either sparse or rich data problems. In all, this package is intended to provide a fast
  overview of dynamics within a given regression problem dataset, allowing the user to decide
  for apropiate further modeling  maybe within a classical statistical framework or to stay
  within the RF-modeling and look deep into  the alluring topology of correlations and
  local interactions.
