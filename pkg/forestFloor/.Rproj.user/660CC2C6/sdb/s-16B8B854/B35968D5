Latests 2D colour gradient is fetched from object global.col in .GlobalEnv. show3d() uses openGL rendering through the rgl-package. Image will emerge in external graphical device and can controlled by mouse pointer.\n\n}\n\\usage{\nshow3d(x, order_by_importance = F, which_matrices = c(\"X\", \n    \"X\", \"FCmatrix\"), x_cols = 1, y_cols = 2, z_cols = c(1:2), \n    plot.surface = T, grid.lines = 30, k = 5, alpha.surf = 0.4, \n    alpha.obs = 0.4, size.obs = 3, z_scale = 0.7, knnBag = 20, \n    bag.ratio = 0.5, avoidFreeType = T, ...) \n%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.\n}\n\\arguments{\n  \n  \\item{x}{\n  also abbrivated ff. \n  Computed topology of randomForest-model, the output object from the forestFloor function of class forestFloor\n  }\n  \\item{order_by_importance}{\n   = FALSE: indices refer to variable order in original training data. (good for scripting) \\cr\n   = TRUE:  indices refer to importanced ordered. (good for user interaction)\n  }\n  \\item{which_matrices}{\n  a char vector of length 3, with names of object data should be fetched. As default is \n  c(\"X\", \"X\", \"FCsCV\"); indices of X_cols and y_cols will be fetched from training set matrix and z_cols from feature contribution matrix. Any matrix in forstFloor.object can theoretically accessesible for plotting. This setting is rarely changed.\n  }\n  \\item{x_cols}{\nvector of one or multiple col indices for x_axis.

By default col indices refers training variable matrix ordered by importance.\n\n  }\n  \\item{z_cols}{\nvector of one or multiple col indices for z_axis. By default col indices refers training feature contribution matrix ordered by importance. z_cols would most times hold both or some of the indice numbers from x_cols and y_cols.\n  }\n  \\item{plot.surface}{\nTRUE/FALSE\n  }\n  \\item{grid.lines}{\ninteger 2 to many. How many grid.lines in surface response. 30 grid.lines = 30^2 = 900 anchorpoints\n  }\n  \\item{k}{\ninteger from 1 to many. k amount of nearest neighbors to estimate response of anchor point in surface. Higher values will smooth surface and make it biased. Lower values will be increase noise.\n  }\n  \\item{alpha.surf}{\na number within [0;1]\ntransparency of surface, lower values more transparent\n  }\n  \\item{alpha.obs}{\na number within [0;1]\ntransparency of observations, lower values more transparent\n }\n  \\item{size.obs}{\nA postive number as the size of observations.\n  }\n  \n  \\item{z_scale}{\nnumeric, near zero to larger number. Steapness of surface. Between 0.1 and 10 are reasonable settings. Paremeter is passed directly to rgl-functions.\n  }\n  \\item{knnBag}{\ninteger, 1 to many. How many times should kNN be bootstrapped and estimated for each anchorpoint. High values increase reproducibility of surface rarely more than 20 is needed.\n  }\n  \\item{bag.ratio}{\nnumeric number between near zero and one. The ratio of used observations over all observations used in each bootstrapped surface estimation. Values less than one, will increase amount above k nearest neighbors used in estimation of each anchorpoint. Nearest neighbors will participate in most estimations and have a high weighting, more distant neighbors will participate gradually more rarely and yield a lower weighting. bag.ratio is therefore a non-metric pseudo gaussian weighting paremeter.\n  }\n  \n  \\item{avoidFreeType}{\n  avoidFreeType pass specificly to rgl function not to use vector.based labels. \\cr\n  freeType make labels look better but must installed externally in operating system and it could take some time.\n  }\n  \n    \\item{...}{\n  ... other arguments passed to generic rgl-functions rgl::pers3d and rgl::points3d  or rgl::plot3d when plot_surface=FALSE.\n  }\n  \n}\n\\details{\nshow3d allows to plot data from ff, the forestFloor-object.\nMost users will only need to change following:\nx_cols, y_cols the featurespace axis \\cr\nz_cols the feature contributions axis \\cr\n...and sometimes these arguments: \\cr\nk the smoothness of the surface\\cr\nsurface was very simple to implement, in long run would true gaussian weighting paremeter maybe be advantageous.\n}\n\n\\value{\nno value\n\n}\n\n\\author{\nSoren Havelund Welling\n}\n\n\\examples{\n#simulate data\nobs=1000 \nvars = 6 \nX = data.frame(replicate(vars,rnorm(obs))) \nY = with(X, X1^2 + sin(X2*pi) + 2 * X3 * X4 + 0.5 * rnorm(obs)) \n\n#grow a forest, remeber to include inbag\nrfo=randomForest::randomForest(X,Y,keep.inbag=TRUE)\n\n#compute topology\nff = forestFloor(rfo,X)\n\n#print forestFloor\nprint(ff) \n\n#plot partial functions of most important variables first\nplot(ff,plot_seq=NULL,colour_by=\"dummy, no defined color-template\",col_axis=1) \n\n#Non interacting functions are well displayed, whereas X3 and X4 are not\n#by applying different colourgradient, interactions reveal themself \nplot(ff,plot_seq=NULL,colour_by=3,col_axis=1) \n\n#in 3D the interaction between X3 and X reveals itself completely\nshow3d(ff,x_cols=3,y_cols=4,z_cols=3:4) \n\n#although no interaction, a joined additive effect of X1 and X2\n#can also be informative to display in 3D\nplot(ff,plot_seq=NULL,colour_by=4,col_axis=2) #use plot first to define colours \nshow3d(ff,x_cols=1,y_cols=2,z_cols=1:2) \n\n}\n% Add one or more standard keywords, see file 'KEYWORDS' in the\n% R documentation directory.\n\\keyword{ ~kwd1 }\n\\keyword{ ~kwd2 }% __ONLY ONE__ keyword per line\n",
