In all, this package is intended to provide a fast\n  overview of dynamics within a given system of interest, allowing the user to decide\n  for apropiate further modeling  maybe within a classical statistical framework or to stay\n  within the RF-modeling and look deep into  the alluring topology of correlations and\n  local interactions.\n}\n\\details{\n\\tabular{ll}{\nPackage: \\tab forestFloor\\cr\nType: \\tab Package\\cr\nVersion: \\tab 1.0\\cr\nDate: \\tab 2014-12-07\\cr\nLicense: \\tab GPL-2\\cr\n}\n}\n\\examples{\n  first grow a regression randomForest with randomForest or binary classification forest with cinbag \\cr\n  code example: rfo = randomForest(X,Y,keep.inbag=T) \\cr\n  X is matrix[n x p] or data.frame, here Y is a numeric target vector \\cr \n\n  forestFloor() - this function searches all nodes of all trees of forest and outputs a forestFloor-object('ff'). \\cr\n  a ff-object contains the central topology representation a matrix[n x p], also called featureContributions \\cr\n  this matrix have same dimensions as training data matrix, X. \\cr\n  code example: ff = forestFloor(rfo,X) \\cr\n  \n  print.forestFloor() - prints summary of ff.object\n  code example: print(ff)\n  \n  plot.forestFloor() - this function plots partial function plot of most important variables.\n  Automatic colourgradiants ease perception of latent dimensions and multi-way interactions.\n  code example: plot(ff,colour_by=\"PCA\")\n  \n  show3d() - this function can plot topology in 3D, usally is X and Y axis used to each represent one or more variables alone or combine.\n  Z usully represent feature contributions of one or more variables. Latest colour gradient from plot.forestFloor() is applied.\n  Besides the position of each training data point, a XY response surface is estimated. The surface suggest a robust interpretation of\n  the topology the training data points is forming. 3d representation is plotted with rgl package.\n  code example: show3d(ff,x_cols=1,y_cols=2  ,z_cols=1:2) #plotting combined response of var1 and var2 as function of var1 and var2.\n\n}\n\\author{\nSÃ¸ren Havelund Welling\n}\n\\references{\nInterpretation of QSAR Models Based on Random Forest Methods, http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/minf.201000173 \\cr\nInterpreting random forest classification models using a feature contribution method, http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.1121 \\cr\n\n}\n\n\\keyword{ package,randomForest,featureContributions,rgl}\n\\seealso{\n\n}\n\\examples{\n#simulate data\nobs=1000 \nvars = 6 \nX = data.frame(replicate(vars,rnorm(obs))) \nY = with(X, X1^2 + sin(X2*pi) + 2 * X3 * X4 + 0.5 * rnorm(obs)) \n\n#grow a forest, remeber to include inbag\nrfo=randomForest(X,Y,keep.inbag=TRUE)\n\n#compute topology\nff = forestFloor2(rfo,X)\n\n#print forestFloor\nprint(ff) \n\n#plot partial functions of most important variables first\nplot(ff,plot_seq=NULL,colour_by=\"dummy, no defined color-template\",col_axis=1) \n\n#Non interacting functions are well displayed, whereas X3 and X4 are not\n#by applying different colourgradient, interactions reveal themself \nplot(ff,plot_seq=NULL,colour_by=3,col_axis=1) \n\n#in 3D the interaction between X3 and X reveals itself completely\nshow3d(ff,x_cols=3,y_cols=4,z_cols=3:4) \n\n#although no interaction, a joined additive effect of X1 and X2\n#can also be informative to display in 3D\nplot(ff,plot_seq=NULL,colour_by=4,col_axis=2) #use plot first to define colours\nshow3d(ff,x_cols=1,y_cols=2,z_cols=1:2)\n}",
